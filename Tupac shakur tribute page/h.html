                  2Pac's debut album, 2pacalypse Now, arrived in 1991 on Interscope. The album peaked at No. 64 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and No. 13 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It yielded the poignant single “Brenda's Got a Baby,” about a 12-year-old girl who becomes pregnant by her cousin and tries to hide it from her family. Pac's debut, though uneven at times, also produced “Trapped,” one of his rawest songs about oppression and the subsequent decisions born of that subjugation.

                  Ronald Ray Howard shot and killed a Texas Highway Patrol Trooper in 1992; he had cocaine and cannabis in his system when he did it, but authorities and the press drew their attention to the music Howard was allegedly listening to when he committed the murder: "Soulja's Story," from 2Pacalypse Now. Seizing on the opportunity to make a statement, Vice President Dan Quayle called on Pac's record company Interscope to withdraw the album, and the trooper's family sued Pac and Interscope for millions of dollars (the suit was dismissed).

                  Tupac was charged with shooting two white off-duty police officers in Atlanta in 1993. Pac was approached by the two, who claimed Pac had nearly hit them with his car. An exchange of words turned into an exchange of bullets as one of the officers fired at Pac's car, and Pac shot both men, only wounding them. Pac was arrested, but the conduct and gun possession of the two officers were called into question, and charges against all parties were eventually dropped.

                  Possibly his biggest run-in with the justice system, Tupac and two members of his entourage were charged with sexual abuse following an incident in a New York hotel. The woman claimed was repeatedly raped by Tupac and his crew, though Pac consistently denied the charges. “I'm young, black, and 22, and I'm making money,” he told reporters about the case. “They can't find a way to make me dirty.”

                  Tupac was shot during an armed robbery in a studio off of Times Square in NYC.

But during his short time in the hospital, Pac had another pivotal moment—finally meeting his father, Billy Garland. “Right then I thought I had died and gone to Heaven,” Pac said of meeting Garland.

While awaiting sentencing, he spoke to Vibe's Kevin Powell. “I had a job,” Pac said, “and I never showed up.” He hadn't raped the young woman, but he hadn't stopped it either. “I'm going to show people my true heart,” Tupac said. “I'm going to show them the man that my mother raised.” He ended up being sentenced to four and a half years in the maximum-security facility at Dannemora, New York.

In return, Tupac signed a deal with Death Row that named Knight's lawyer David Kenner as his legal representative and Knight himself as controller of his business affairs. Pac immediately hit the studio and within six days of his release had recorded 14 songs.

                  Almost a year to the day after his sentencing, Tupac released rap's first double album, All Eyez on Me. Like most double albums, it was uneven in scope, but the stellar production from Dr. Dre, Daz and Devonte Swing often overshadowed what it lacked, and it remains one of Pac's most revered recordings to this day. He was bigger than ever, his fame cemented by the controversy of his jail stint, movie appearances, simmering beef with Biggie, and ambitious album release. All Eyez on Me was his second No. 1 album, and the last to be released in his lifetime.

"Hit 'Em Up" sees Pac spitting flame at not just Biggie, but the entire Bad Boy roster, including Junior M.A.F.I.A. and Lil' Kim, as well as Mobb Deep. Tupac hits low — "You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife," he says, targeting Biggie and his wife, Faith Evans. He even taunts Prodigy for his sickle-cell diagnosis. If the east coast-west coast beef had been smoldering before, "Hit 'Em Up" set the whole thing on fire.

Tupac Amaru Shakur died on September 13, 1996. He was 25.
